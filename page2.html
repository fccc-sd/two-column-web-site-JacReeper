                <p> Hi I'm <strong>Joshua Cole</strong> and I am a programer in training and this is a webpage all about me. I enjoy playing video games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanfall_2" title="titanfall 2 wiki"><em><strong>Titanfall 2</strong></em></a>,
                    <a href="https://hades.fandom.com/wiki/Hades_(game)" title="Hades wiki"><em><strong>Hades</strong></em></a>, and <a href="https://terraria.org" title="terraria home page"><em><strong>Terraria</strong></em></a>.
                    But I also love to draw and make animations. I grew up always wanting to make my own video game and now thanks to my teacher (<a href="https://mrgeiger.com" title="mrgeiger.com">Mr.Geiger</a>) I might be able to acheve my goals and become a game developer and make my own games for others to enjoy.
                    <span id="videoGames">On Mondays and Thursdays I go to <em><strong>Esports</strong></em> practice because I'm on a <em><strong>Overwatch</strong></em> Team and I'm also on a <em><strong>Valorant</strong></em> Team. On the <em><strong>Overwatch</strong></em> Team
                    my main role is support and for the <em><strong>Valorant</strong></em> Team I mainly play control type characters.</span>
                    On Tuesday I have a DnD night with some of my friends from Esports. I play as a High Elf Bard.
                    On Friday I go to watch the Napoleon Band at there foot ball games because I used to be in band and I have some friends that are still in band. I used to play the trombone. I have earned 2 medals and a plaque from solo and ensamble.
                    Because of work, School, Esports, DnD, and football season I usually dont have much free time but I try to at least spend my time on the weekends with my girlfriend.
