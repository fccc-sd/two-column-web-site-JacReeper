                    Hi, Welcome to Joshua Cole's webpage!<br>
                    This webpage is all about me and my Interests. <br>
                    You are currently on the Home page. <br>
                    There is not much here. <br>
                    If you want to learn more about me go to the about me page. <br>
                    Or If you want you can check out the Gallary with Interesting photos in it. 
                    Or you could just stay here, on the home page, where NOTHING happens.<br><br><br><br>
                    Why are You still here?<br>
                    I told You that nothing is gonna happen so why are you still reading?<br>
                    Why?<br>
                    Do you think there is a secret? because there isn't, there is nothing here just a blank webpage.
                    <br>
